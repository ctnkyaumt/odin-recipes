    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A delicious option for homemade pizza! Butter garlic sauce, chicken, 
        tomato, and ricotta and Parmesan cheeses are baked together 
        for a delightfully light pizza.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
        <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place the chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. 
          Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. 
          Drain and cool slightly, then cut into strips.</p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter with garlic, 
          onion and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate until set.</p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Roll out the pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, 
          and spread the herb butter over the surface using the back of a spoon. 
          Arrange chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices, 
          cilantro and Parmesan cheese.</p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned 
          and center is cooked through.</p>
